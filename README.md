# python-django_portfolio_website


1. My main aim is to learn firstly the basics of Django and web development. I will be using Linux Mint OS, GitKraken for version control and PyCharm for Python IDE.

2. Secondly create a portfolio (which can be used by architects, designers etc...) website with quick review/zoom capabilities,     infinite scrolling. On the top there should be some buttons seen all the way trough scrolling. At the very bottom some hyperlinks forwarding to informative part of the scrolling site or separate link.

Further details will be added on the go.
